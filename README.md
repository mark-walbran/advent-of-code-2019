Solutions to the first 11 days of the 2019 Advent of Code coding challenge (https://adventofcode.com/2019/)

## Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a Christmas-themed coding challenge released every December.
There is a new coding challenge released every day from Dec 1st to Dec 24th, making an "Advent Calendar" of coding challenges.
The problems get progressively more complex and difficult as as the days go on.
For more details please see the site at the URL above.

I did the first 11 days of challenges and the solutions can be found here.
I chose to do these challenges in Python, a language I had never used before, as an extra challenge.
It was enjoyable doing the challenge with a language I wasn't yet familiar with and I learned a lot about Python through the process.

## Running code
To run the code you will require Python 3.

Steps to run each day:
1. Navigate to the relevant folder for day `<X>` with: `cd Dec<X>`
2. Run the code with `python3 dec<X>.py`
